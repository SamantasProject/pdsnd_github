I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major US cities: Chicago, New York and Washington.<br>I set up a script that takes in raw input and creates an interactive experience in the terminal, presenting descriptive statistics related to the use of bike sharing in the cities above.<br><br>

**<h3>Files used</h3>**

* bikeshare.py
* chicago.csv
* washington.csv
